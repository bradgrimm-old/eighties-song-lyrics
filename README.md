# HireVue Valentine's Day Box

We have a Valentine's day tradition at HireVue Engineering to create a box and Valentine's. With a bunch of engineers the ideas get pretty creative. This year the competition was 80's themed. We created a model that was trained on 80's Song Lyrics, and brought back GeoCities.

This was that website.

Note: This assumes there is a clone encore.ai in the root folder:
https://github.com/snard6/encore.ai

It also assumes s model has been trained is in that structure.

### This was hacked together fairly quickly, and is mostly just here for historical purposes.
